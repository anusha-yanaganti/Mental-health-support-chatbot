# Mental Health Support Chatbot

---

## Project Overview
This is my Infosys Springboard internship project. The **Mental Health Support Chatbot** is designed to provide emotional and moral support through meaningful conversations. Utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the chatbot offers users a supportive, non-judgmental space to share their feelings and receive compassionate responses. The user-friendly interface is built using **Streamlit**.

## Project Statement and Outcomes

### Project Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that listens to people and provides emotional and moral support through meaningful replies. The chatbot will be accessible through a user-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**. By leveraging NLP and ML techniques, this chatbot offers users a supportive, non-judgmental space to share their feelings and receive compassionate responses.

### Project Outcomes
Upon completion, the chatbot will:
- Enable users to engage in conversations where they can express their thoughts and emotions.
- Be trained to recognize and respond to various emotional states, providing empathetic and helpful replies.
- Offer a valuable tool for users seeking emotional support and a safe space to talk about their mental health.
