Project Statement and Outcomes
The objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that listens to people and provides emotional and moral support through meaningful replies. The chatbot will be accessible through a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit. By leveraging NLP and ML techniques, this chatbot offers users a supportive, non-judgmental space to share their feelings and receive compassionate responses.

Upon completion, the mental health support chatbot will enable users to engage in conversations where they can express their thoughts and emotions. The chatbot will be trained to recognize and respond to various emotional states, providing empathetic and helpful replies. This tool will be valuable for users seeking emotional support and a safe space to talk about their mental health.
